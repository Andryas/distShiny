# Main Discrete and Continuous Models in Shiny

***

The models in this Shiny application, which are commonly used in basic statistics courses, aim to help students from various fields understand the main probability distributions.

The models covered are:

### **Discrete Models**
- [X] Discrete Uniform Model <!-- Probability calculation -->
- [X] Bernoulli/Binomial Model <!-- Probability calculation -->
- [X] Negative Binomial Model <!-- Probability calculation -->
- [X] Geometric Model <!-- Distribution expression and probability calculation -->
- [X] Poisson Model <!-- Distribution expression and probability calculation -->
- [X] Hypergeometric Model <!-- Distribution expression and probability calculation -->

### **Continuous Models**
- [X] Continuous Uniform Model <!-- Distribution expression and probability calculation -->
- [X] Exponential Model
- [X] Normal Model
- [X] Gamma Model
- [X] Beta Model

To access the Shiny application, simply open R, install the **shiny** and **devtools** packages if they are not already installed, and run the following command:

```
# install.packages(c("shiny","devtools"))
shiny::runGitHub("andryas/distShiny")
```

Alternatively, you can access the Shiny application through this [link](http://andryaswaurzenczak.shinyapps.io/distshiny).

Voil√†.
